# craigslist-search-alert
Search [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites) using saved search parameters. Any number of searches can be run at the same time. Results are stored to a database for later analysis. New results are sent as an alert to a given email address.

## Disclaimer

I have no affiliation with Craigslist.

This project was created for educational purposes. I do not endorse its use for crawling or downloading data from Craigslist.

## Usage
1. Add search parameters to the configuration file **searches_config.yml**, in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format. Any number of searches can be added to **searches_config.yml**. Only those with `status: active` will be processed. Only those with `email: youremail@mail.com` will have new records send via email.

2. Run search.py:
```
python search.py
```

3. Search results are saved to a database, currently a file called **database.pickle** * in [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) format. If there is no database file, one will be created.

  * Currently, there are no analysis functions provided for analyzing the database. 


## Project Status
This project a work in progress.

Although the Python script **search.py** works, it is currently lacking: finesse, adequate template(s) for **searches_config.yml**, error handling and validations.
